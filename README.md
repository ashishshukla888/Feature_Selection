# Feature Selection using Filter Methods

Welcome to the repository on feature selection using filter methods. In this repository, 
explore various filter methods for selecting the most relevant features in a dataset. 
Filter methods used to identify the features that contribute the most to our models.

## Introduction

In machine learning, feature selection plays a crucial role in improving model performance, reducing overfitting, and speeding up training times. Among different methods for feature selection, filter methods are some of the simplest yet effective techniques.

In this repository, we explore four common filter methods: Variance Threshold, Correlation, ANOVA, and Chi-Square Test. Each of these methods has its unique way of selecting relevant features based on different statistical criteria.

## Filter Methods

### Variance Threshold

The **Variance Threshold** method focuses on removing features with low variance. Features with low variance are considered less informative because 
they don't change significantly across different samples.

### Correlation

**Correlation-based feature selection** aims to identify features that are highly correlated with the target variable. Highly correlated features 
may contain redundant information, and removing them can simplify the model.

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

**ANOVA** is a statistical technique used to analyze the differences among group means in a dataset. In feature selection, ANOVA can help us identify 
features that have a significant impact on the target variable.

### Chi-Square Test

The **Chi-Square Test** is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. In feature selection, it can help us 
identify categorical features that are most relevant to the target variable.

## Usage

To use these filter methods for feature selection, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The notebook demonstrates how to 
apply each method using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
